This is my fork of the embedded operating system code for the
OpenStomp Coyote-1 digital guitar effects unit
(http://www.openstomp.com). It contains new effects modules which I am
developing as well as (possibly) some tweaks to the core OS.

Compiled using Parallax's Propeller Tool.

To control what effects modules ('COYOTE1_MODULE_*.spin') are compiled
in, edit 'COYOTE1_static_module_list.spin'.
