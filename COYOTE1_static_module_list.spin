'' TITLE: COYOTE1_static_module_list.spin
''
'' DESCRIPTION:
''     This file contains the list of any MODULES which will be staticly
''   linked at compile time.
''     In order to create a dynamic MODULE, the MODULE must first be compiled
''   into the O/S as a static MODULE, then moved to a DYNAMIC module slot
''   using OpenStomp Workbench.
''     Modules are generally developed as STATIC modules so that
''   they can be quickly re-compiled/modified/debugged, then migrated to
''   DYNAMIC modules once they are stable/finished/released.
''     You can use OpenStomp Workbench to load and run DYNAMIC modules you
''   download from the website or the forums without ever needing to
''   link them into your OS build or compile them from source.
